Delivery of radiofrequency current or cryotherapy to create a lesion in the area of interest destroys the selected tissue and prevents arrhythmias.<p> The HRA catheter is typically placed close to the SA node. The RV catheter is usually positioned in the ventricular apex to record right ventricular activity and for right ventricular pacing. The His bundle catheter is placed across the tricuspid valve to record a His bundle electrogram. A multielectrode catheter is placed in the coronary sinus to record electrical activity in the coronary sinus.

The insert on the lower left, shows the electrical sensing by this lead (upper trace, the electrocardiogram) and the relative pressures being generated by the left ventricle within this same heart (lower trace).  Initially a normal sinus rhythm (or heart rate) is being recorded, then the heart is activated by the system/electrode (T-shock) to induce an arrhythmia: i.e., ventricular tachycardia (VT) was induced which subsequently degraded to ventricular fibrillation (VF).  The implanted defibrillator system then continuously was sensing this induced change in the electrical activity of the heart, subsequently and automatically, the system delivered a high energy shock to the heart; which then defibrillated it, and a normal sinus rhythm was re-established.  One should note that during the induce arrhythmia(s), left ventricular pressures essentially went to zero and then subsequently rose when a more normal heart rate was re-established. Note, that such a sequence of events is induced clinically, to to properly set both the sensing and shock voltages of such implantable defibrillator systems.

The video then transitions to footage within a reanimated human heart in the Visible Heart Laboratory.<p>

The pulmonary artery (PA) catheter is a highly useful multi-lumen, balloon tipped diagnostic catheter. The balloon on the tip helps to guide the catheter, acting as a &lsquo;sail&rsquo; in the flow of blood and also reduces injury to the tissue by acting as a cushion. PA catheters can measure pressures of the heart in multiple chambers of heart, cardiac output via thermodilution, and blood oxygen saturation or tissue oxygen saturation.<p>

The pressure monitoring of the catheter is of particular benefit due to the fact that multiple chambers can be monitored simultaneously. The right atrial, right ventricular, pulmonary artery, and indirect left atrial (&lsquo;wedge pressure&rsquo;) pressures can all be monitored. Due to the fact that there is a pressure lumen distal to the balloon on the tip of the catheter, the catheter can be &lsquo;wedged&rsquo; into a small pulmonary artery. When the balloon occludes the artery, the tip sensor is essentially detecting the pressure of the left atria because the lungs are a low resistance path of blood flow. This measurement is particularly useful in assessing fluid status, function of the right and left heart, or the presence of ventricular failure or pulmonary edema to guide therapeutic measures.<p>

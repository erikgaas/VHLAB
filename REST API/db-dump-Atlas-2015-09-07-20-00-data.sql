The video then transitions to footage within a reanimated human heart in the Visible Heart Laboratory.<p>\n\nThe pulmonary artery (PA) catheter is a highly useful multi-lumen, balloon tipped diagnostic catheter. The balloon on the tip helps to guide the catheter, acting as a sail in the flow of blood and also reduces injury to the tissue by acting as a cushion. PA catheters can measure pressures of the heart in multiple chambers of heart, cardiac output via thermodilution, and blood oxygen saturation or tissue oxygen saturation.<p>\n\nThe pressure monitoring of the catheter is of particular benefit due to the fact that multiple chambers can be monitored simultaneously. The right atrial, right ventricular, pulmonary artery, and indirect left atrial (wedge pressure) pressures can all be monitored. Due to the fact that there is a pressure lumen distal to the balloon on the tip of the catheter, the catheter can be wedged into a small pulmonary artery. When the balloon occludes the artery, the tip sensor is essentially detecting the pressure of the left atria because the lungs are a low resistance path of blood flow. This measurement is particularly useful in assessing fluid status, function of the right and left heart, or the presence of ventricular failure or pulmonary edema to guide therapeutic measures.<p>\n\nA similar video was published in 2012 in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine titled The Path of a Pulmonary Artery Catheter Visualized through a Beating Human Heart.',0,0,1,0,0),(2245,'Heart0156','video','2012-07-18 16:31:28','2012-09-05 21:38:14','Heart0156-3D-Modeling-Blood-Volume-Pediatric','A 3D reconstruction of the blood volume from a specimen exhibiting the characteristics of a pediatric patient with mild dilated cariomyopathy.
